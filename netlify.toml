# Netlify Configuration for Nerva Website
# This file configures how Netlify builds and serves the static website
# Documentation: https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/

[build]
  # Build Configuration
  base = "website"
  # ↑ Directory containing the Next.js application and package.json
  
  command = "npm run build"
  # ↑ Command to build the static export
  # Runs 'next build' which generates static files in the 'out' directory
  
  publish = "out"
  # ↑ Directory to serve as the website (relative to base directory)
  # Contains the static HTML, CSS, JS files generated by Next.js
  
[build.environment]
  # Node.js Environment
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  # ↑ Specify Node.js version for consistent builds
  # Nerva requires Node.js 18+ for all dependencies to work properly

# URL Redirect Rules
# Handle client-side routing for single-page application (SPA)
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  # ↑ Catch all routes that don't match static files
  
  to = "/index.html"
  # ↑ Serve the main React app which handles routing
  
  status = 200
  # ↑ Return 200 (not 301/302) so the URL stays the same
  # This allows React Router to handle the routing

# Performance: Cache Static Assets
# Set aggressive caching for files that rarely change
[[headers]]
  for = "/static/*"
  # ↑ Cache Next.js static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000"
    # ↑ Cache for 1 year (31536000 seconds)

[[headers]]
  for = "*.js"
  # ↑ Cache JavaScript files (including Next.js chunks)
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000"
    # ↑ Cache for 1 year - JS files have content hashes in filenames

[[headers]]
  for = "*.css"
  # ↑ Cache CSS stylesheets
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000"
    # ↑ Cache for 1 year - CSS files have content hashes in filenames

[[headers]]
  for = "*.json"
  # ↑ Cache JSON data files (like scripts.json)
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=3600"
    # ↑ Cache for 1 hour (3600 seconds) - data may update more frequently

# Security Headers
# Add security headers to all pages
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  # ↑ Apply to all pages and files
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    # ↑ Prevent the site from being embedded in iframes (clickjacking protection)
    
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    # ↑ Enable browser XSS protection
    
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    # ↑ Prevent MIME type sniffing
